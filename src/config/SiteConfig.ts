          "Absolutely phenomenal service. I asked for help on check a trade. I booked with the first company to reply but then they let me down, and I'm glad they did because the moment I asked Layton to quote, I knew this was the right company to book. My (asbestos) garage roof was replaced about 6 years ago and already developed cracks. Layton immediately knew how to fix, was given a quote to fix the damaged part and another quote to sort the whole lot, and went with the latter so I don't have to think about it again anytime soon. Immediately identified what was wrong with previous install and fixed that on top of what was quoted. I am over the moon, team were on time to the minute, clearly experienced professionals who take pride in their work, my only regret is not finding you 6 years ago! I'll be recommending you to everyone... Cheers gents, you're all fabulous!",
